# 📈 Deep Reinforcement Learning for Algorithmic Trading 🤖

[cite_start]This project demonstrates an automated stock trading strategy using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)[cite: 12]. [cite_start]An agent is trained using a **Deep Q-Learning algorithm** on historical stock data to learn how to make profitable trading decisions[cite: 13]. [cite_start]The goal is to create a self-learning system that dynamically adapts its strategy to maximize financial returns by deciding whether to **buy**, **sell**, or **hold** assets[cite: 15].

[cite_start]The model was trained and evaluated on historical daily data for **NVIDIA (NVDA)**, a stock selected for its high liquidity and volatility, which provides a challenging and realistic test case[cite: 14].

## ⚙️ Methodology

The trading agent was built using a value-based reinforcement learning method, where it learns the expected return of taking an action in a given state.

### 📊 1. Data and Environment
* [cite_start]**Data Source**: Historical stock data was acquired from **Polygon.io**[cite: 36]. [cite_start]The closing price was used as the key indicator for market trends[cite: 30].
* [cite_start]**State Representation**: To capture price movement patterns, the model uses a **rolling window of 15 days**[cite: 31]. This window of historical prices serves as the "state" that the agent observes before making a decision.
* [cite_start]**Data Preprocessing**: The input data is standardized and normalized using a sigmoid function to prepare it for the neural network[cite: 32].
* [cite_start]**Dataset Split**: The dataset was divided into 80% for training the agent and 20% for testing its performance on unseen data[cite: 38].

### 🏋️‍♂️ 2. Training Process
* [cite_start]**Learning Algorithm**: The core of the agent is a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**[cite: 33].
* [cite_start]**Training Episodes**: The model was trained for over **300 episodes** to allow sufficient time for learning[cite: 43].
* [cite_start]**Experience Replay**: An experience replay mechanism was implemented to store past transitions (state, action, reward, next state)[cite: 43]. [cite_start]This technique helps stabilize the learning process by reducing the correlation between consecutive samples[cite: 44].
* **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: To ensure the agent explores various strategies while also capitalizing on known good ones, an **epsilon-greedy strategy** was used. [cite_start]The value of epsilon was gradually decayed from `1.0` (full exploration) to `0.01` (mostly exploitation) over the course of the training[cite: 45].

## 🏗️ Q-Network Architecture

The Deep Q-Network is the 🧠 brain of the trading agent. It is a neural network designed to approximate the Q-values, which represent the expected future rewards for each action (buy, sell, hold) in a given state.

* [cite_start]**Network Structure**: The DQN is composed of **three fully connected (dense) layers**[cite: 40].
* [cite_start]**Activation Function**: The **Leaky ReLU** activation function is used in the hidden layers[cite: 40]. This prevents the "dying ReLU" problem and helps the network learn more effectively from the complex patterns in financial data.
* [cite_start]**Optimizer**: The network weights are optimized using the **Adam optimizer** with a learning rate of `0.00005`[cite: 41]. Adam is well-suited for noisy data like stock prices.
* [cite_start]**Loss Function**: **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** is used as the loss function to measure the difference between the predicted Q-values and the target Q-values[cite: 42].
* [cite_start]**Overfitting Prevention**: **Dropout layers** are included in the architecture[cite: 40]. These layers randomly deactivate a fraction of neurons during training, which prevents the model from becoming overly specialized to the training data and improves its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

## 🏆 Results and Performance

[cite_start]The trained agent was evaluated on the test dataset to assess its ability to make informed trading decisions on unseen stock data[cite: 52]. [cite_start]The results were highly encouraging and demonstrated that the DRL system **outperformed basic trading benchmarks** in simulated environments[cite: 54].

Key performance metrics used for evaluation include:
* [cite_start]**Total Profit** [cite: 47] 💰
* [cite_start]**Win Rate** (percentage of profitable trades) [cite: 48] ✅
* [cite_start]**Sharpe Ratio** (risk-adjusted returns) [cite: 49] ⚖️
* [cite_start]**Max Drawdown** (worst loss from a peak) [cite: 49] 📉

The model showed a strong ability to identify profitable actions and manage risk, as indicated by a good win rate and a low maximum drawdown.

## 💡 Conclusion and Future Work

[cite_start]This study successfully demonstrates that Deep Reinforcement Learning is a **viable technique** for building automated stock trading systems[cite: 59]. [cite_start]The agent learned to adapt to market conditions and execute actions that boosted profit in the simulation[cite: 60].

While the current results are promising, the following enhancements could further improve the model for practical, real-world deployment 🚀:
* **Higher Frequency Data**: Reduce the time frame from daily to hourly or even minutely data to build a more responsive trading agent.
* [cite_start]**Expanded Action Space**: Allow the agent to decide *how much* of an asset to buy or sell, rather than just a fixed amount[cite: 56].
* [cite_start]**Advanced Risk Management**: Integrate more sophisticated risk mitigation tools and strategies directly into the agent's decision-making process[cite: 56, 61].
* [cite_start]**Real-Time Integration**: Adapt the system to process live market data for real-time trading decisions[cite: 61].
